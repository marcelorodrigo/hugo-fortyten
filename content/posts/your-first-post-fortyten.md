Writing with Hugo FortyTen is like a walk in the park—with Treta at your side!

1. Run `hugo new posts/my-first-post.md` to start your post
2. Open the file and add your thoughts, stories, or photos
3. Preview via `hugo server`
4. Commit your changes for the world to see

You can structure posts as bundles for images, or keep it classic. The theme handles formatting and display.
