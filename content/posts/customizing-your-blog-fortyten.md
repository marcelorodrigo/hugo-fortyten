Make it yours! Hugo FortyTen uses Hugo’s template blocks and Tailwind for instant, code-friendly customization.

**Quick tips:**
- Change colors, spacing, or fonts in `tailwind.config.js`.
- Use the `/layouts/partials/` folder to update header, menu, or footer.
- Add local assets (like images or fonts) to `/static/`.

Experiment with page blocks—the theme's foundation for flexible layouts. See the demo site for live examples!
